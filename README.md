# wastewater-flow-anomaly-prediction
Hybrid deep learning pipeline using LSTM and GNN for flow prediction and anomaly detection in wastewater systems. Leverages multivariate time-series data from interconnected nodes and edges to capture both temporal and spatial patterns for accurate forecasting.

Data set

The dataset includes wastewater system node/edge metadata (pipe connections, hydraulic properties) and time-series measurements (flow rates, water depth) from sensor networks. It undergoes temporal alignment, MinMax normalization, and SMOTE balancing to handle class imbalances for anomaly detection.
